Further North: to Orkney!

Here's somewhere I was fascinated to visit for a while. Between the notoriously rich (largely Viking) history, the Scandinavian heritage, and the isolated, extreme location within the Scottish isles, I had plenty of reason to pick Orkney for the next stage of my adventure. Due to the small size of the islands, the ease of ferrying between them with a bike, and the trivially easy wildcamping, cycle touring seems brilliantly suited to exploring Orkney. (Let's forget about the wind for now. The islands are very exposed, and there's a good reason that approximately no trees grow on them.)

Every time I started pedalling on Orkney, I came across some incredible piece of history or archeology and had to stop to investigate. This would be a very long post if I wrote about each such occasion, so i'm going to write two posts on Orkney: this one about the ride, and another for the history and archeology.

*"I write this from the ferry, two hours into a six hour journey. I’m warm inside with a coffee, but out of a window blurred by raindrops, a grey-blue sea blends into a marginally lighter sky of homogeneous cloud.*

*It’s pretty damn exciting! I’m headed north again, to explore islands dripping with history, the influence of Picts and Vikings all over. My vague plan is to explore the west Mainland, seeing Maeshow, the Ring of Brodgar, Scara Brae, perhaps stopping at Stromness. Then a stopover on the island Rousay, a twenty-something mile circle cluttered with chambered cairns and brochs. Depending on the date, I might then go across to Hoy - apparently spectacular, but the adverts haven’t convinced me to make it a priority. Then east Mainland, and down across the Churchill barriers to South Ronaldsay and the ‘Tomb of the Eagles’. With such a kvlt name, that’s got to be worth a stop. There are campsites near Kirkwall and Stromness, and i’ve been in contact with a WarmShowers host in Kirkwall, but for the most part I plan to wildcamp. I’m expecting mixed weather, and hoping that there won’t be too much rain or wind."*
