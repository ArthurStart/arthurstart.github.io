Currently i'm cycling from Aberdeen to Amsterdam, and then east. For updates, see [Quick Updates]({% post_url 2016-03-24-Quick-Update %}), or some more detailed posts when I get around to writing them.

I'm Arthur. I like cycling about and visiting new places. I don't hugely like writing about it, but I like to have a record of what i've been up to, and I take a lot of pictures. It seems a shame not to share them sometimes. That's why i'm writing this blog. (Well, i'm waiting for the rain to blow over too.)

Last year (2015) I did some cycle-touring around Scotland, and managed to put two photo albums up on Facebook. I never bothered with the rest, but i'm going to try to publish some more of last year's adventures as blog posts. Right now i'm cycling down to Newcastle, to ferry across to Holland, from where i'll head east and see where I end up. I'll try to blog about this as I go, too. This whole interblog format is pretty unfamiliar to me, and i'd really like to figure out how I can write posts that people enjoy reading, so any feedback is much appreciated.
