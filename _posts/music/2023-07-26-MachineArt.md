### Genuary

Machine Art was composed almost entirely during January 2021 while I was living in Romania. Under the coronavirus lockdown, I found myself in a small rural town with three people, three dogs, and three cats. I had no musical equipment apart from a laptop and a borrowed acoustic guitar. I found Genuary, a generative art prompt-game calling people to make and publish a piece of generative art every day, based on themes given. Most people posted visual art, but I decided to make sounds.

Generative music is that which is made partially by some stochastic (random) process, some algorithm, data source, or such, as well as partially by regular old human composition. Composing generative music involves composing music, and composing processes.

While the end result is a music album, truly the art (as with any generative art) is in the process which went into creating those sounds, as much as it is in the sounds themselves. I hope that the album stands alone - indeed, several people have enjoyed it without any further explanation - however in my opinion, the best way is with some insight into the processes. I hope that this page will go some way towards giving you that insight while you listen to Machine Art.
