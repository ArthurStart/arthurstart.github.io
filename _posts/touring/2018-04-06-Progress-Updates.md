#### Part 1: England
The first two days on the road.

| Day | Date | | Distance (km) |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------  | ----------- |
| 1 | Sat 24th March | Kidlington - N. London | 105 |
| 2 | Sun 25th March | - N. Harwich Ferry Terminal | 130 |
| Tot  | | | 235   |

**17/04/18**
England was tough. I should have (and would have) left three days to get to the ferry, but life got in the way. Life, packing up that life, and learning to ride a motorbike. My Mod 2 (final practical) motorbike test was rescheduled twice, first due to the March snow, and then reasons unknown to Friday afternoon. I had originally intended to leave the Monday before, but such is life. At least I passed!

Anyway, with fresh, untrained legs and a brand-new heavy-duty comfort-not-speed luggage setup, 165 miles in two days felt ambitious. The little shakedown trip with Christian, a few weekends prior, had exhausted me at 30 miles. But, the ferry was booked, and I was to meet Cam there on the Sunday evening.

England isn't so bad, really. Leafy green tracks and little roads took me to North London, where I stayed the night with my granny, before a long Sunday to Harwich ferry terminal. Here, I met with plenty of the expected terrible English drivers who seem to view their vehicles as weapons of intimidation against poor cyclists and pedestrians. However, I was amazed to discover the Epping forest area, home of undoubtedly the best drivers in Britain. It wasn't the prettiest ride, but my mind was on the road ahead anyway.
