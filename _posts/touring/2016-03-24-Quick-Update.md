*\* The bike computer stopped recording a couple of times today. I'm not sure how much it missed, but the mileage is about right, so can't be too much.*

*\*\* No bike computer data from today. Problems with low transmitter battery, and interference with speaker charge cable meant nothing usable. Should be fixed now though. Mileage is approximate, from Google Maps.*

**17/04/16**
Been having a fantastic time in Switzerland, despite some very wet weather. Anja, who I met in St Andrews, and family Heller, showed me some amazing Swiss hospitality and many many types of Swiss alcohol. Recovering some energy tonight so I can push east tomorrow, as the Swiss alpine passes are still closed with snow. Also hopefully i'll get the tent fixed soon.

**15/04/16**
Basel is a cool and exciting place, i'm pleased to have got a little tour. I saw coffee growing, and many other awesome things at the botanical garden. Thanks Myriam and flatmates! Little ride into Switzerland today. It's been rainy, and i've found my first decent hills in Europe. Perhaps a few similarities to Scotland... First serious equipment failure too: tent pole snapped! Bodged together for now but i'll see whether the tent is still standing in the morning.

**14/04/16**
I'm in Switzerland! Awesome Couchsurfers made fondue - very tasty. Basel seems great. But where to go next?

**13/04/16**
What started as a wet, slow, miserable day has turned really great this afternoon and evening. Not the most interesting ride, but France has decided to put up with me, and the scenery is teasing epicness. I happened to come across a friend of the person who i'm staying with tomorrow, we shared food next to the canal, and I had a go on her recumbent - I want one!

**12/04/16**
I'm 7km or so out of Strasbourg. The thunderstorm has passed. I'm sitting in a shelter next to some woods where my tent is hiding, with a bowl of road-soup, and QUOTSA playing. The sky is lit up pink. Quite a bit going on since I last updated.  
Heidelberg is quite the postcard. Incredible views from the Philosophenweg, but pro-tip: don't carry a loaded touring bike up the stairs to the top.  
Then I left my previous top average speed in the dust of a blazing hot day. What factors contributed to this? No tailwind. No tire pressure experimentation. Trick is, I cycled fast lots and didn't cycle slowly very much. I was feeling energetic, only had 35 miles to do, and got a bit self-competitive.  
Last night I got to hear some live Finnish doom metal, and also a jam with some local musicians in Karlsruhe. Thanks David for having me! Once again Couchsurfing is proving brilliant.  
Today I figured i've been in Germany long enough, so i've got my sights set on Basel, and i've been trying out the French side of the Rhine.  
Still working on the next proper blog post, i'll get there...

**10/04/16**
Last night in Mannheim I stayed with Tine, a fascinating and lovely couchsurfer/hitchhiker with a flat full of colour and pattern and good music. Mannheim is a very different place to the cities i'd passed through previously. Today she invited me to stay for lunch with her family and her partner, which was great! Quick ride today to nearby Heidelberg, which is like a postcard. I'll have a proper explore of the old town tomorrow before I set off south again.

**08/04/16**
Couchsurfing is awesome - after three days in the tent, a shower, hot meal, laundry, chat about travel, film, and beer, is exactly what I needed! Thanks Sonja :) Anyway, so the Rhine has more ruined castles than you can shake a dragon at. Seriously, seriously picturesque. There was actually a castle catching sun atop a dark hill framed by a rainbow yesterday. No shit.

**07/04/16 (again)**
So TIL German eggs are inferior to British or Dutch ones. I spent the better part of 1000 miles with at least some eggs in my front left pannier around Britain, and got through a box in the Netherlands too. Never a breakage. But this evening I picked up some German eggs, and by the time I had the tent up, three had broken. What's up with that, Germany? In unrelated news, I had egg fried rice for dinner.

**07/04/16**
Haven't managed to get any updates out in a while, as i've been busy doing things, seeing stuff, seeing things, doing stuff, staying in a tent without Wifi. Here's a few days of updates. In Koblenz now, the Rhine is quite awesome. Working on a post about the Netherlands and Belgium!

**06/04/16**
I'm in *bad* place tonight. Har har har. In all seriousness, I am a terrible cycle tourist. It's so beautiful how people can pick the perfect spot two hours before sundown and spend the evening cooking and meditating and soaking in nature or whatever. About that though... I'll keep trying. Today, I got to two hours before sundown, and there were some more miles I wanted to do. Anyway, i'm almost at the Rhine already. No regrets, camped up in the most tranquil spot.

**05/04/16**
I'm camped in the Netherlands, about 300 meters from Germany and 400 from Belgium. Yesterday I had a beautiful quick ride (dat average) to Maastricht, where I had a brilliant time seeing the city, meeting locals, and visiting the weirdest and possibly best beer bar i've ever been to. Today completed the city tour, and featured a quick trip to a cool blues bar full of character. Thanks to Aleks for the tour and for letting me crash, first Couchsurfing experience definitely a positive one. Got a few miles in before dark, but I found some hills in the Netherlands, and had some slight bike-issues (nothing significant I hope) so it was slow going. Off to join the Rhine next!

**03/04/16**
Relaxed ride to Leuven today. Had a celebratory pizza with the Texans, then said bye to them and now checked into a hostel to recover a bit. Off to explore Leuven now!

**02/04/16**
Pole camping again, this time in Belgium. I spent the day riding with the Texans on their tandem, and this evening we've also been joined by Christoph, a Belgian preparing for a bigger tour. Saw Westmalle this morning. Another campfire tonight, another good meal cooked in an aluminium pan.

**01/04/16**
'Pole camping' in the Netherlands, with a couple of Texans - a moment ago we were sitting on a bench overlooking Belgium. The Netherlands have shot past! Today I did my highest average and lowest top speed, as well as my greatest distance by a hair. Still having an awesome time over here.

**31/03/16**
Everyone is driving on the wrong side, the cyclists are crazy, and the language sounds silly, but the Netherlands is awesome! Really incredible cyclepaths - I haven't enjoyed the actual 'cycling' part of touring so much, well, ever. Rather than stay the day in Haarlem or Amsterdam as i'd intended, i've found myself 56 miles along in Delft. Really pretty and friendly place, I could spend some time here if the cyclepaths weren't so good.

**30/03/16 (again again)**
You'd have thought that the ferry live-musician would know how to tune a guitar, huh? So far the Orkney ferry is winning.
EDIT: Bingo has finished in the other room, so now there's a much better live band. A guy dressed as a Pinnochio just danced/strip-teased to Red Wine - apparently this is normal for Dutch people.

**30/03/16 (again)**
I'm on the ferry, going to another country!

**30/03/16**
I'm in Newcastle now, getting ready for the ferry this afternoon. Yesterday was pretty tough, bit of a headwind. Coming into Newcastle wasn't the most pleasant riding per se, but it was pretty fascinating comparing the urban sprawl to that of Edinburgh - very different feel. Anyway, gotta go buy some euros!

**28/03/16**
Beautiful day. Fast-forwarded (on a train) to Berwick. Explored city briefly. Then headed to Lindisfarne in time to get across the tidal causeway and back. Finally had a tailwind, felt like going downhill all day! Lindisfarne has the priory that vikings attacked in 793, widely regarded as the start of the 'Viking Age' - had to listen to some Amon Amarth on the way back. Now staying with Jonny, a fascinating and welcoming Warmshowers host who has shared great stories and great food.

**27/03/16 (again)**
I've made it to Edinburgh! Long day, not the nicest weather, but not nearly as bad as day 2. Cycling the Forth Road Bridge was pretty awesome.

**27/03/16**
Yesterday I had a nice relaxed ride to St Andrews where I took a bit of a rest day. I needed it after the day before! St Andrews is a lovely quaint and very old university town (third oldest university in the English speaking world apparently - cute [not that i'm smug about that]). Saw some cool buildings and ruins, found a couple of Geocaches, and ended up staying in the hostel where I met Swiss sisters and a Kiwi guy. Swapped some travel stories and felt very unadventurous, as is the danger with hostels. Drank a couple of beers and booked a ferry - i'm off abroad!

**25/03/16**  
Day 2 done. Really tough day today. The distance is on the long side for starting out, but what really kills is the headwind. Spent most of the day exhausting myself while barely crawling forward. Anyway, I made it to Dundee when Stef has kindly put me up for tonight. Looks like the wind is keeping up for the next few days so I might be changing plans. I spent some of the long day composing haikus:

Fuck right off headwind.  
Except when hair blows in my face,  
Tailwind is cooler.
