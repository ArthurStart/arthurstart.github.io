**07/05/16**
As i've been riding, i've been listening to podcasts, most recently about the history of WW1 (Dan Carlin's 'Blueprint for Armageddon' series). This evening I visited the bridge where Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, sparking the whole thing. Pretty fitting! Sarajevo seems nice so far. Bosnia is an entirely different world from Western Europe.

**05/05/16**
A concern has crossed my mind before, that once I got this far east, i'd be skimming over the surface of the countries, wildcamping out of sight each night, interacting with the locals only so far as is necessary to buy food. I thought maybe that I wouldn't discover so much about the culture and history of the area. And, most worryingly, that I wouldn't have anything interesting to blog about... (I thought I might even be able to catch up on the backlog.) Well, so far, I need not have been concerned.

Yesterday, I rode possibly the furthest i've ever done in one day, to Slavonski Brod. There I stayed with the coolest and most fascinating couple in an otherwise dull town. Manja and Tomislav made me feel at home, and really gave me an impression of what Croatia is like (a very candid impression, certainly not all good). They farm goats and make cheese for a living, and this morning I got to meet the goats and further find out what life is like there. Today, though I was sorely tempted to take Manja up on her offer of another night in Slavonski Brod, I have begun heading into Bosnia & Herzegovina, towards Sarajevo. Hampered by a very dramatic thunderstorm (earth shattering crashes of thunder, sky rent asunder, etc. etc.) i've nonetheless got quite a first impression. Through asking whether I could camp in a nearby field, I have ended up meeting a family, being given beer and food from the whole pig freshly roasted over a fire, being invited into the house for coffee, offered a hut to stay in, all despite very little shared language. I've gained a bunch of Facebook friends (some literally from the side of the road), had demonstrated just how hospitable the Bosnians can be already, and i'm feeling a little like some kind of superstar visiting from faraway foreign dream-lands.

**03/05/16**
Croatia is a very different beast to Slovenia. I've experienced the huge, smoggy, vibrant urban metropolis of Zagreb, then decrepit farmsteads and time-machine villages, giving way to a lush green countryside complete with vineyards. Tonight i've had an insight into the small village life. Checking my map in Kutina to find a place to camp, a local came and offered help. Then offered to buy me a coffee. Then showed me a place I could camp. Then changed his mind and offered to let me stay in the spare room in his house. And so as we walked 7km back, I learnt all sorts about Croatia, from the economic situation (catastroph!) to the modern culture. I'm tenting in his family's garden now, and more than happy with it: honestly Adam, your country isn't that cold!

**02/05/16**
So on Saturday on the walking tour of Ljubljana, I met two Germans, an Austrian, and a Croatian, and ended up spending the afternoon exploring the city with them. This evening i've met up with Anna and Daniela again in Zagreb where they're on Erasmus, they've shown me Zagreb and we've had a few beers. Sometimes doing touristy things turns out to be really great value. If they get around to booking it, we'll have a gig to play in Belgrade next weekend, too!

**01/05/16**
I've got a month left now, and the deadline finally bears my signature. I'm sad to have an end in sight! Aiming for Istanbul, which is 771 miles south-east as the crow flies. Way behind on this blog, i've been too busy enjoying myself lately.

**01/05/16**
Ended up staying an extra day in Ljubljana, i've met a load of travellers and some locals and for (a) rest day(s) it has not been very restful at all, but i've been having a great and memorable time. Picked up some stories. Almost ready to get out into the rain again, i'm gathering moss and eager to get onto the road.

**28/04/16 (again)**
So Slovenia is the first country where I don't have a semi-reliable stereotype to set my expectations. My raw and relatively unbiased first impression is great.

The first night was not so pleasant: I arrived a refugee from the Italian drivers and thunderstorm shortly before dark, in heavy rain. I found a suitable and pleasant wood, however to omit the expletives, let's just say that the tent pole broke, again. Same failure mode, different place. When Vango say that pole breakages are considered normal wear and tear, apparently they mean it. Well let's not dwell, fortunately the rest of my kit is serving me excellently, and I got the tent bodged once more.

Since they, i've experienced warm and friendly people, picturesque landscapes, beautiful mountain roads (wasn't expecting to climb to 900m), lots and lots of unseasonal snow, more picturesque landscapes, and some very gracious CS hosts tonight. Looking forward to getting to know the place a little better!

#### Part 5: Italy
Days 30-35 on the road.

| Day | | Distance (miles) | Start/Stop | Time Moving | Av./Max Speed (mph) |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------  | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 22/4 | Laas - Lavis    | 76.28 | 09:15/18:15 | 6:15:47 | 12.2/30.7 |
| 23/4 | - Levico Terme  | 22.89 | 16:15/19:30 | 2:27:16 |  9.3/31.9 |
| 24/4 | - Padova        | 77.66 | 10:00/18:30 | 6:21:56 | 12.1/31.2 |
| 25/4 | - Venice (Mestre) | 28.05 | 14:00/17:30 | 2:45:25 | 10.1/17.5 |
| 26/4 | - near Eraclea  | 30.74 | 15:30/18:45 | 2:40:17 | 11.5/19.5 |
| 27/4 | - near Rožna Dolina | 68.66 | 09:30/19:00 | 5:54:30 | 11.6/21.2 |

**28/04/16**
Been riding hard for a few days, not managed to update or upload this. My honest review of Italy will wait for another day, but i'll say now that of all the countries i've visited, Italy is the first where I can say that I wouldn't be disappointed never to return. This does a terrible disservice to the really wonderful people who hosted me, and some others I met along the way, and for them I am truly grateful. I'm also able to tuck Venice away as an experience that i'll never forget. All in all, certainly worth it. On a more positive note, my last day in which I dashed for the border was largely pleasant and smooth cycling, until Italy had a last laugh by throwing a little thunderstorm my way. Arrivederci Italy, perhaps.

**26/04/16 (again)**
I forgot to mention it, but when I got to Padova on Sunday, I crossed the milestone of being more than 1000 miles from Aberdeen where I started, as the crow flies. I'm also now a fair chunk closer to Istanbul than the Aberdeen. (If anyone is following my route, I may or may not have a new destination in mind.)

**26/04/16**
Bad Italian cycling infrastructure is really, ridiculously terrible. Like, official signposted (well...) bike path being underwater so I had to backtrack and join the busy road terrible. And I thought that arrows were a pretty foolproof graphical tool for indicating direction, until I got to Italy.

I get that out of the way first, so that I can now mention Venice. It is a fantastic (in the literal sense) and enchanting city. Last night I got the bus over, then put away all my maps and GPS, and just got as lost as I could for a couple of hours, with John Frusciante in one ear. Today I got a slightly more mainstream, touristy view of the place with a walking tour. It's so rich with character and wonder, I couldn't hope to adequately describe the place without a vocabulary boost. It is certainly particular, as at least one Italian has described it to me.

**25/04/16**
Yesterday I finally left the mountains and valleys, and reached a flatter, more industrial, somewhat less beautiful and impressive part of Italy. Staying with Federico, another cyclist, who took me to an electronic music concert last night, awesome new cultural experience! Quite different to Nadia's garden. Italy is a very diverse place.

**23/04/16**
Fascinating day: very un-touristy little cafe for breakfast, where I tried a very *very* local creation, the hazelnut heart. Nadia and her gardening-buddy Damiano took me to see their community garden, a weird kinda artistic organic garden in the most incredible setting where they experiment with all sorts of symbiotic combinations of tasty vegetables. Damiano is hugely passionate about agriculture, and I got a fantastic tour. Not the most productive day's ride - I left late anyway, but then underestimated the climb out of Trento, and had some trouble navigating the un-German bike paths, but at least the promised rain didn't materialise until I stopped. Towards Venice tomorrow, probably.

**22/04/16**
Today's headwind has a name! Rode a pretty huge distance into the Garda Lake Wind, quite proud that I managed to keep the pedals turning and keep the average up - the locals thought I was crazy, even got a 'bravo'. Baking hot, humid day, scenery straight out of sci-fi. I'm staying with Nadia and Dario, a really lovely Italian couple who have taken me out for delicious ice cream and taught me all about Italy and it's many linguistic complexities. Italy is certainly growing on me.

#### Part 4: Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Austria
Days 23-29 on the road.

| Day | | Distance (miles) | Start/Stop | Time Moving | Av./Max Speed (mph) |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------  | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 15/4 | Basel - Seppenweid     | 26.65 | 16:30/19:30 | 2:49:22 |  9.4/22.2 |
| 16/4 | - Sursee               | 25.39 | 10:00/14:00 | 2:12:55 | 11.4/32.6 |
| 17/4 | - Zug                  | 29.39 | 13:30/19:00 | 3:06:26 |  9.4/28.6 |
| 18/4 | - Mels                 | 62.43 | 10:00/19:00 | 5:57:41 | 10.4/26.5 |
| 19/4 | - Dalaas               | 47.42 | 10:30/19:30 | 4:17:53 | 11.0/26.8 |
| 20/4 | - near Ried            | 46.60 | 10:30/18:30 | 4:55:50 |  9.4/40.7 |
| 21/4 | - Laas                 | 52.29 | 10:30/19:00 | 5:42:15 |  9.1/33.7 |

**21/04/16**
Local campsite wanted €17 for a pitch, and so I am sitting high above a wide valley, the sun just set over the mountains from whence I came today, watching the bustle in the valley and listening to the bells around the necks of the goats on the hillside below me. Today in numbers: border crossings - 3; countries - 3; languages that I don't know - 3; pizzas - 0; altitude reached - 1530m; coffees - just one. Italy has been mixed so far. At first I considered heading straight back to Austria, but i'll give the place a chance. I haven't really scratched the surface of the culture, but in my defense that's tricky when everywhere is shut and everyone is presumably asleep.

**20/04/16**
Pretty incredible day today. Climbed the Arlberg pass over the Austrian Alps, getting to an altitude of 1800m. It was stunning. And then the other side! Pretty sure i've set my highest daily max/av speed ratio, my highest brake pad wear per distance travelled, and also my top speed on this bike, today. Strange and awesome cocktail of brain chemicals going on. On my way to do another Alpine pass into Italy via a little corner of Switzerland, then on to flatter ground and east again. But right now, i'm on a bench next to the cyclepath, under a very clear night with the stars starting to come out above snowy mountains. Got Earth playing, the rushing of a river in the background, and my tent is tucked away behind some trees (mostly fixed now). The few people i've met in Austria have been really friendly, and i'm definitely hoping to get to know the place a bit better sometime.

**19/04/16**
Switzerland still wet and cloudy. Warming up by Liechtenstein - I barely put my feet to the ground and passed into Austria before i'd noticed. Switzerland gave me one last incredible view of the Alps. Austria is fighting the good fight for being more beautiful, more picturesque, more welcoming than Switzerland. So far Austrian Alps are better than Swiss Alps, but the fact that they're not hidden in a cloud is working to their advantage. Sorry Anja - i'll think about a return visit!  
So i've heard about people asking after camping spots and being taken in to a local's house, but tonight is the first time it's happened to me. "Come on in, we'll have a tea or coffee... Or a beer. I think a beer." Many thanks to Veronica and her husband, who motorbike tour around Asia. May the people you meet be as kind to you as you have been to me. Good start, Austria, good start.

**18/04/16**
Everything is wet: I am wet. My face is wet. The outside of the tent is wet, and the inside of the tent is wet too (not to mention falling down). My shoes are soaked. My phone is wet. The inside of my camera is wet and the last few pictures are fuzzy. D'Schwiiz is just one big raincloud today, and i've got a lot of great views of the inside of it. However, there's not been a headwind. I've had a good day.

**17/04/16**
Been having a fantastic time in Switzerland, despite some very wet weather. Anja, who I met in St Andrews, and family Heller, showed me some amazing Swiss hospitality and many many types of Swiss alcohol. Recovering some energy tonight so I can push east tomorrow, as the Swiss alpine passes are still closed with snow. Also hopefully i'll get the tent fixed soon.

**15/04/16**
Basel is a cool and exciting place, i'm pleased to have got a little tour. I saw coffee growing, and many other awesome things at the botanical garden. Thanks Myriam and flatmates! Little ride into Switzerland today. It's been rainy, and i've found my first decent hills in Europe. Perhaps a few similarities to Scotland... First serious equipment failure too: tent pole snapped! Bodged together for now but i'll see whether the tent is still standing in the morning.

**14/04/16**
I'm in Switzerland! Awesome Couchsurfers made fondue - very tasty. Basel seems great. But where to go next?

#### Part 3: Germany and France

*\* The bike computer stopped recording a couple of times today. I'm not sure how much it missed, but the mileage is about right, so can't be too much.*

*\*\* No bike computer data from today. Problems with low transmitter battery, and interference with speaker charge cable meant nothing usable. Should be fixed now though. Mileage is approximate, from Google Maps.*

**13/04/16**
What started as a wet, slow, miserable day has turned really great this afternoon and evening. Not the most interesting ride, but France has decided to put up with me, and the scenery is teasing epicness. I happened to come across a friend of the person who i'm staying with tomorrow, we shared food next to the canal, and I had a go on her recumbent - I want one!

**12/04/16**
I'm 7km or so out of Strasbourg. The thunderstorm has passed. I'm sitting in a shelter next to some woods where my tent is hiding, with a bowl of road-soup, and QUOTSA playing. The sky is lit up pink. Quite a bit going on since I last updated.  
Heidelberg is quite the postcard. Incredible views from the Philosophenweg, but pro-tip: don't carry a loaded touring bike up the stairs to the top.  
Then I left my previous top average speed in the dust of a blazing hot day. What factors contributed to this? No tailwind. No tire pressure experimentation. Trick is, I cycled fast lots and didn't cycle slowly very much. I was feeling energetic, only had 35 miles to do, and got a bit self-competitive.  
Last night I got to hear some live Finnish doom metal, and also a jam with some local musicians in Karlsruhe. Thanks David for having me! Once again Couchsurfing is proving brilliant.  
Today I figured i've been in Germany long enough, so i've got my sights set on Basel, and i've been trying out the French side of the Rhine.  
Still working on the next proper blog post, i'll get there...

**10/04/16**
Last night in Mannheim I stayed with Tine, a fascinating and lovely couchsurfer/hitchhiker with a flat full of colour and pattern and good music. Mannheim is a very different place to the cities i'd passed through previously. Today she invited me to stay for lunch with her family and her partner, which was great! Quick ride today to nearby Heidelberg, which is like a postcard. I'll have a proper explore of the old town tomorrow before I set off south again.

**08/04/16**
Couchsurfing is awesome - after three days in the tent, a shower, hot meal, laundry, chat about travel, film, and beer, is exactly what I needed! Thanks Sonja :) Anyway, so the Rhine has more ruined castles than you can shake a dragon at. Seriously, seriously picturesque. There was actually a castle catching sun atop a dark hill framed by a rainbow yesterday. No shit.

**07/04/16 (again)**
So TIL German eggs are inferior to British or Dutch ones. I spent the better part of 1000 miles with at least some eggs in my front left pannier around Britain, and got through a box in the Netherlands too. Never a breakage. But this evening I picked up some German eggs, and by the time I had the tent up, three had broken. What's up with that, Germany? In unrelated news, I had egg fried rice for dinner.

**07/04/16**
Haven't managed to get any updates out in a while, as i've been busy doing things, seeing stuff, seeing things, doing stuff, staying in a tent without Wifi. Here's a few days of updates. In Koblenz now, the Rhine is quite awesome. Working on a post about the Netherlands and Belgium!

**06/04/16**
I'm in *bad* place tonight. Har har har. In all seriousness, I am a terrible cycle tourist. It's so beautiful how people can pick the perfect spot two hours before sundown and spend the evening cooking and meditating and soaking in nature or whatever. About that though... I'll keep trying. Today, I got to two hours before sundown, and there were some more miles I wanted to do. Anyway, i'm almost at the Rhine already. No regrets, camped up in the most tranquil spot.

#### Part 2: The Netherlands and Belgium
Days 8-13 on the road. [Blog post here.]({% post_url 2016-04-06-The-Netherlands-and-Belgium %})

| Day | | Distance (miles) | Start/Stop | Time Moving | Av./Max Speed (mph) |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------  | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 31/3 | IJmuiden - Delft       | 56.22 | 09:30/18:30 | 5:04:16 | 11.0/24.6 |
| 01/4 | - Gooren en Krochten   | 65.77 | 10:30/20:00 | 5:42:18 | 11.5/20.2 |
| 02/4 | - near Westerlo        | 52.62 | 10:30/18:30 | 4:34:55 | 11.4/20.2 |
| 03/4 | - Leuven               | 19.59 | 11:30/14:00 | 1:44:39 | 11.2/19.0 |
| 04/4 | - Maastricht           | 50.42 | 11:00/18:00 | 4:14:16 | 11.8/22.5 |
| 05/4 | - Drielandenpunt       | 20.31 | 17:00/20:00 | 2:04:41 |  9.7/27.4 |

**05/04/16**
I'm camped in the Netherlands, about 300 meters from Germany and 400 from Belgium. Yesterday I had a beautiful quick ride (dat average) to Maastricht, where I had a brilliant time seeing the city, meeting locals, and visiting the weirdest and possibly best beer bar i've ever been to. Today completed the city tour, and featured a quick trip to a cool blues bar full of character. Thanks to Aleks for the tour and for letting me crash, first Couchsurfing experience definitely a positive one. Got a few miles in before dark, but I found some hills in the Netherlands, and had some slight bike-issues (nothing significant I hope) so it was slow going. Off to join the Rhine next!

**03/04/16**
Relaxed ride to Leuven today. Had a celebratory pizza with the Texans, then said bye to them and now checked into a hostel to recover a bit. Off to explore Leuven now!

**02/04/16**
Pole camping again, this time in Belgium. I spent the day riding with the Texans on their tandem, and this evening we've also been joined by Christoph, a Belgian preparing for a bigger tour. Saw Westmalle this morning. Another campfire tonight, another good meal cooked in an aluminium pan.

**01/04/16**
'Pole camping' in the Netherlands, with a couple of Texans - a moment ago we were sitting on a bench overlooking Belgium. The Netherlands have shot past! Today I did my highest average and lowest top speed, as well as my greatest distance by a hair. Still having an awesome time over here.

**31/03/16**
Everyone is driving on the wrong side, the cyclists are crazy, and the language sounds silly, but the Netherlands is awesome! Really incredible cyclepaths - I haven't enjoyed the actual 'cycling' part of touring so much, well, ever. Rather than stay the day in Haarlem or Amsterdam as i'd intended, i've found myself 56 miles along in Delft. Really pretty and friendly place, I could spend some time here if the cyclepaths weren't so good.

#### Part 1: Aberdeen to Amsterdam (nearly)
Days 1-7 on the road. [Blog post here.]({% post_url 2016-03-30-Aberdeen-to-Amsterdam %})

| Day | | Distance (miles) | Start/Stop | Time Moving | Av./Max Speed (mph) |
| --- | ---------------- | ----------  | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 24/3 | Aberdeen - Lairhillock | 12.60 | 17:30/19:15 | 1:10:05 | 10.7/23.6 |
| 25/3 | - Dundee               | 65.48 | 10:00/20:45 | 7:39:42 |  8.5/29.8 |
| 26/3 | - St Andrews           | 13.35 | 10:00/12:30 | 1:25:03 |  9.4/21.8 |

| 30/3 | - Ferry terminal       |  9.72 | 13:45/15:00 | 1:03:53 |  9.1/22.5 |

**30/03/16 (again again)**
You'd have thought that the ferry live-musician would know how to tune a guitar, huh? So far the Orkney ferry is winning.
EDIT: Bingo has finished in the other room, so now there's a much better live band. A guy dressed as a Pinnochio just danced/strip-teased to Red Wine - apparently this is normal for Dutch people.

**30/03/16 (again)**
I'm on the ferry, going to another country!

**30/03/16**
I'm in Newcastle now, getting ready for the ferry this afternoon. Yesterday was pretty tough, bit of a headwind. Coming into Newcastle wasn't the most pleasant riding per se, but it was pretty fascinating comparing the urban sprawl to that of Edinburgh - very different feel. Anyway, gotta go buy some euros!

Beautiful day. Fast-forwarded (on a train) to Berwick. Explored city briefly. Then headed to Lindisfarne in time to get across the tidal causeway and back. Finally had a tailwind, felt like going downhill all day! Lindisfarne has the priory that vikings attacked in 793, widely regarded as the start of the 'Viking Age' - had to listen to some Amon Amarth on the way back. Now staying with Jonny, a fascinating and welcoming Warmshowers host who has shared great stories and great food.

I've made it to Edinburgh! Long day, not the nicest weather, but not nearly as bad as day 2. Cycling the Forth Road Bridge was pretty awesome.

Yesterday I had a nice relaxed ride to St Andrews where I took a bit of a rest day. I needed it after the day before! St Andrews is a lovely quaint and very old university town (third oldest university in the English speaking world apparently - cute [not that i'm smug about that]). Saw some cool buildings and ruins, found a couple of Geocaches, and ended up staying in the hostel where I met Swiss sisters and a Kiwi guy. Swapped some travel stories and felt very unadventurous, as is the danger with hostels. Drank a couple of beers and booked a ferry - i'm off abroad!

Day 2 done. Really tough day today. The distance is on the long side for starting out, but what really kills is the headwind. Spent most of the day exhausting myself while barely crawling forward. Anyway, I made it to Dundee when Stef has kindly put me up for tonight. Looks like the wind is keeping up for the next few days so I might be changing plans. I spent some of the long day composing haikus:

Fuck right off headwind.  
Except when hair blows in my face,  
Tailwind is cooler.
