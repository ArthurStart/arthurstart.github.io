Yesterday I had a nice relaxed ride to St Andrews where I took a bit of a rest day. I needed it after the day before! St Andrews is a lovely quaint and very old university town (third oldest university in the English speaking world apparently - cute [not that i'm smug about that]). Saw some cool buildings and ruins, found a couple of Geocaches, and ended up staying in the hostel where I met Swiss sisters and a Kiwi guy. Swapped some travel stories and felt very unadventurous, as is the danger with hostels. Drank a couple of beers and booked a ferry - i'm off abroad!

Day 2 done. Really tough day today. The distance is on the long side for starting out, but what really kills is the headwind. Spent most of the day exhausting myself while barely crawling forward. Anyway, I made it to Dundee when Stef has kindly put me up for tonight. Looks like the wind is keeping up for the next few days so I might be changing plans. I spent some of the long day composing haikus:

Fuck right off headwind,  
Except when hair blows in my face,  
Tailwind is cooler.
