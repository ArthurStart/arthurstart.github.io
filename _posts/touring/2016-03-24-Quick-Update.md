**30/03/16 (again)**
I'm on the ferry, going to another country!

**30/03/16**
I'm in Newcastle now, getting ready for the ferry this afternoon. Yesterday was pretty tough, bit of a headwind. Coming into Newcastle wasn't the most pleasant riding per se, but it was pretty fascinating comparing the urban sprawl to that of Edinburgh - very different feel. Anyway, gotta go buy some euros!

**28/03/16**
Beautiful day. Fast-forwarded (on a train) to Berwick. Explored city briefly. Then headed to Lindisfarne in time to get across the tidal causeway and back. Finally had a tailwind, felt like going downhill all day! Lindisfarne has the priory that vikings attacked in 793, widely regarded as the start of the 'Viking Age' - had to listen to some Amon Amarth on the way back. Now staying with Jonny, a fascinating and welcoming Warmshowers host who has shared great stories and great food.

**27/03/16 (again)**
I've made it to Edinburgh! Long day, not the nicest weather, but not nearly as bad as day 2. Cycling the Forth Road Bridge was pretty awesome.

**27/03/16**
Yesterday I had a nice relaxed ride to St Andrews where I took a bit of a rest day. I needed it after the day before! St Andrews is a lovely quaint and very old university town (third oldest university in the English speaking world apparently - cute [not that i'm smug about that]). Saw some cool buildings and ruins, found a couple of Geocaches, and ended up staying in the hostel where I met Swiss sisters and a Kiwi guy. Swapped some travel stories and felt very unadventurous, as is the danger with hostels. Drank a couple of beers and booked a ferry - i'm off abroad!

**25/03/16**  
Day 2 done. Really tough day today. The distance is on the long side for starting out, but what really kills is the headwind. Spent most of the day exhausting myself while barely crawling forward. Anyway, I made it to Dundee when Stef has kindly put me up for tonight. Looks like the wind is keeping up for the next few days so I might be changing plans. I spent some of the long day composing haikus:

Fuck right off headwind,  
Except when hair blows in my face,  
Tailwind is cooler.
